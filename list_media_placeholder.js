// Initialize Supabase (Using public anon key from src/supabase.js if available, but I'll grab them from config/supabase.js or just view the file to get them)
// I need the URL and Key. I'll read src/supabase.js first to get them.
// Wait, I can't import from src/supabase.js easily because it uses ES modules and I might run this with node.
// I will just read src/supabase.js content first.
